# Circos plot visualization to show active ligand-target links between interacting cells  
This vignette shows how NicheNet can be used to predict active ligand-target links between multiple interacting cells and how you can make a circos plot to summarize the top-preidcted links (via the circlize package). This vignette starts in the same way as the main, basis, NicheNet vignette. In contrast to the basic vignette, we will look communication between multiple cell types. More specifically, we will predict which ligands expressed by both CAFs and endothelial cells can indiuce the p-EMT program in neighboring malignant cells.  

## Load packages required for this vignette  
```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE}
library(nichenetr)
library(tidyverse)
library(circlize)
```


## Read in expression data of interacting cells  
First, we will read in the publicly available single-cell data from CAFs, endothelial cells malignant cells from HNSCC tumors.  
```{r}
hnscc_expression <- readRDS(file = "/home/yincy/git/Data/NicheNet/data/hnscc_expression.rds")
expression <- hnscc_expression$expression
sample_info <- hnscc_expression$sample_info
```


Secondly, we will determine which genes are expressed in CAFs, endothelial and malignant cells from high quality primary tumors. Therefore, we will not consider cells from tumor samples of less quality or from lymph node metastases.  
```{r}
tumors_remove = c("HN10","HN","HN12", "HN13", "HN24", "HN7", "HN8","HN23")

CAF_ids = sample_info %>% 
  filter(`Lymph node` == 0 & !(tumor %in% tumors_remove) & `non-cancer cell type` == "CAF") %>% 
  pull(cell)

endothelial_ids = sample_info %>% 
  filter(`Lymph node` == 0 & !(tumor %in% tumors_remove) & `non-cancer cell type` == "Endothelial") %>% 
  pull(cell)

malignant_ids = sample_info %>% 
  filter(`Lymph node` == 0 & !(tumor %in% tumors_remove) & `classified  as cancer cell` == 1) %>% 
  pull(cell)

expressed_genes_CAFs = expression[CAF_ids,] %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){10*(2**x - 1)}) %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){log2(mean(x) + 1)}) %>% 
  .[. >= 4] %>% names()

expressed_genes_endothelial = expression[endothelial_ids,] %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){10*(2**x - 1)}) %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){log2(mean(x) + 1)}) %>% 
  .[. >= 4] %>% names()

expressed_genes_malignant = expression[malignant_ids,] %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){10*(2**x - 1)}) %>% 
  apply(2,function(x){log2(mean(x) + 1)}) %>% 
  .[. >= 4] %>% names()
```


# load the ligand-target model 
```{r}
ligand_target_matrix <- readRDS(file = "/home/yincy/git/Data/NicheNet/data/ligand_target_matrix.rds")
ligand_target_matrix %>% .[1:5, 1:5]
```


## Load the gene set of interest and backgroud of genes  
As gene set of interest, we consider the genes of which the expression is possibly affected due to communication with other cells.  

Because we here want to investigate how CAFs and endothelial cells regulate the expression of p-EMT genes in malignant cells, we will use the p-EMT gene set defined by Puram et al. as gene set of interset and use all genes expressed in malignant cells as background of genes.  
```{r}
pemt_geneset <- readr::read_tsv(file = "/home/yincy/git/Data/NicheNet/data/pemt_signature.txt", 
                                col_names = F) %>% 
  pull(X1)

background_expressed_genes <- expressed_genes_malignant %>% 
  .[. %in% rownames(ligand_target_matrix)]

background_expressed_genes %>% head()
```


## Perform NicheNet's liagnd activity analysis on the gene set of interest  
In a first step, we will define a set of potentially active ligands. As potentially active ligands, we will use ligands that are 1) expressed by CAFs and/or endothelial cells and 2) can bind a (putative) receptor expressed by malignant cells. Putative ligand-receptor links were gathered from NicheNet’s ligand-receptor data sources.  

Note that we combine the ligands from CAFs and endothelial cells in one ligand activity analysis now. Later on, we will look which of the top-ranked ligands is mainly expressed by which of both cell types.  
```{r}
lr_network <- readRDS(file = "/home/yincy/git/Data/NicheNet/data/lr_network.rds")

ligands <- lr_network %>% 
  pull(from) %>% 
  unique()
expressed_ligands_CAFs <- intersect(ligands, expressed_genes_CAFs)
expressed_ligands_endothelial <- intersect(ligands, expressed_genes_endothelial)
expressed_ligands <- union(expressed_ligands_CAFs, expressed_ligands_endothelial)

receptors <- lr_network %>% 
  pull(to) %>% 
  unique()
expressed_receptors <- intersect(receptors, expressed_genes_malignant)

potential_ligands <- lr_network %>% 
  filter(from %in% expressed_ligands & to %in% expressed_receptors) %>% 
  pull(from) %>% 
  unique()

potential_ligands %>% head()
```

Now perform the ligand activity analysis: infer how well NicheNet’s ligand-target potential scores can predict whether a gene belongs to the p-EMT program or not.  
```{r}
ligand_activities <- predict_ligand_activities(geneset = pemt_geneset, 
                                               background_expressed_genes = background_expressed_genes, 
                                               ligand_target_matrix = ligand_target_matrix, 
                                               potential_ligands = potential_ligands)
```

Now, we want to rank the ligands based on their ligand activity. In our validation study, we showed that the pearson correlation between a ligand’s target predictions and the observed transcriptional response was the most informative measure to define ligand activity. Therefore, we will rank the ligands based on their pearson correlation coefficient.  

```{r}
ligand_activities %>% 
  arrange(-pearson)
```

```{r}
best_upstream_ligands <- ligand_activities %>% 
  top_n(n = 20, wt = pearson) %>% 
  arrange(-pearson) %>% 
  pull(test_ligand)
```

We see here that the top-ranked ligands can predict the p-EMT genes reasonably, this implies that ranking of the ligands might be accurate as shown in our study. However, it is possible that for some gene sets, the target gene prediction performance of the top-ranked ligands would not be much better than random prediction. In that case, prioritization of ligands will be less trustworthy.  
```{r}
best_upstream_ligands %>% intersect(expressed_ligands_CAFs)
```

```{r}
best_upstream_ligands %>% intersect(expressed_ligands_endothelial)
```

lot of overlap between both cell types in terms of expressed ligands therefore, determine which ligands are more strongly expressed in which of the two  
```{r}
ligand_expression_tbl <- tibble(
  ligand = best_upstream_ligands, 
  CAF = expression[CAF_ids, best_upstream_ligands] %>% apply(2, function(x){10*(2**x - 1)}) %>% apply(2, function(x){log2(mean(x) + 1)}), 
  endothelial = expression[endothelial_ids, best_upstream_ligands] %>% apply(2, function(x){10*(2**x - 1)}) %>% apply(2, function(x){log2(mean(x) + 1)}))

CAF_specific_ligands <- ligand_expression_tbl %>% 
  filter(CAF > endothelial + 2) %>% 
  pull(ligand)

endothelial_specific_ligands <- ligand_expression_tbl %>% 
  filter(endothelial > CAF + 2) %>% 
  pull(ligand)

general_ligands <- setdiff(best_upstream_ligands, c(CAF_specific_ligands))
ligand_type_indication_df <- tibble(
  ligand_type = c(rep("CAF-specific", times = CAF_specific_ligands %>% length()), 
                  rep("General", times = general_ligands %>% length()), 
                  rep("Endothelial-specific", times = endothelial_specific_ligands %>% length())), 
  ligand = c(CAF_specific_ligands, general_ligands, endothelial_specific_ligands)
)
```

## Infer target genes of top-ranked ligands and visualize in a circos plot  
Now we will show how you can look at the regulatory potential scores between ligands and target genes of interest. In this case, we will look at links between top-ranked p-EMT-regulating ligands and p-EMT genes. In this example, inferred target genes should belong to the p-EMT gene set and to the 250 most strongly predicted targets of at least one of the selected top-ranked ligands (the top 250 targets according to the general prior model, so not the top 250 targets for this dataset).  

Get first the active ligand-target links by looking which of the p-EMT genes are among the top-predicted target genes for the prioritized ligands:  
```{r}
active_ligand_target_links_df <- best_upstream_ligands %>% 
  lapply(get_weighted_ligand_target_links, geneset = pemt_geneset, ligand_target_matrix = ligand_target_matrix, n = 250) %>% 
  bind_rows()

active_ligand_target_links_df <- active_ligand_target_links_df %>% 
  mutate(target_type = "p-emt") %>% 
  inner_join(ligand_type_indication_df, by = "ligand")
```

To avoid making a circos plots with too many ligand-target links, we will show only links with a weight higher than a predefined cutoff: links belonging to the 66% of lowest scores were removed. Note that this cutoffs and other cutoffs used for this visualization can be changed according to the user’s needs.  
```{r}
cutoff_include_all_ligands <- active_ligand_target_links_df %>% 
  pull(weight) %>% 
  quantile(probs = 0.66)

active_ligand_target_links_df_circos <- active_ligand_target_links_df %>% 
  filter(weight > cutoff_include_all_ligands)

ligands_to_remove <- setdiff(active_ligand_target_links_df %>% pull(ligand) %>% unique(), active_ligand_target_links_df_circos %>% pull(ligand) %>% unique())

target_to_remove <- setdiff(active_ligand_target_links_df %>% pull(target) %>% unique(), active_ligand_target_links_df_circos %>% pull(target) %>% unique())

circos_links <- active_ligand_target_links_df %>% 
  filter(!target %in% target_to_remove &!ligand %in% ligands_to_remove)
```

Prepare the circos visualization: give each segment of ligands and target a specific color order  
```{r}
grid_col_ligand =c("General" = "lawngreen",
            "CAF-specific" = "royalblue",
            "Endothelial-specific" = "gold")
grid_col_target =c(
            "p_emt" = "tomato")

grid_col_tbl_ligand = tibble(ligand_type = grid_col_ligand %>% names(), color_ligand_type = grid_col_ligand)
grid_col_tbl_target = tibble(target_type = grid_col_target %>% names(), color_target_type = grid_col_target)

circos_links = circos_links %>% mutate(ligand = paste(ligand," ")) # extra space: make a difference between a gene as ligand and a gene as target!
circos_links = circos_links %>% inner_join(grid_col_tbl_ligand) %>% inner_join(grid_col_tbl_target)
links_circle = circos_links %>% select(ligand,target, weight)

ligand_color = circos_links %>% distinct(ligand,color_ligand_type)
grid_ligand_color = ligand_color$color_ligand_type %>% set_names(ligand_color$ligand)
target_color = circos_links %>% distinct(target,color_target_type)
grid_target_color = target_color$color_target_type %>% set_names(target_color$target)

grid_col =c(grid_ligand_color,grid_target_color)

# give the option that links in the circos plot will be transparant ~ ligand-target potential score
transparency = circos_links %>% mutate(weight =(weight-min(weight))/(max(weight)-min(weight))) %>% mutate(transparency = 1-weight) %>% .$transparency 
```

Prepare the circos visualization: order ligands and targets  
```{r}
target_order = circos_links$target %>% unique()
ligand_order = c(CAF_specific_ligands,general_ligands,endothelial_specific_ligands) %>% c(paste(.," ")) %>% intersect(circos_links$ligand)
order = c(ligand_order,target_order)
```

Prepare the circos visualization: define the gaps between the different segments  
```{r}
width_same_cell_same_ligand_type = 0.5
width_different_cell = 6
width_ligand_target = 15
width_same_cell_same_target_type = 0.5

gaps = c(
  # width_ligand_target,
  rep(width_same_cell_same_ligand_type, times = (circos_links %>% filter(ligand_type == "CAF-specific") %>% distinct(ligand) %>% nrow() -1)),
  width_different_cell,
  rep(width_same_cell_same_ligand_type, times = (circos_links %>% filter(ligand_type == "General") %>% distinct(ligand) %>% nrow() -1)),
  width_different_cell,
  rep(width_same_cell_same_ligand_type, times = (circos_links %>% filter(ligand_type == "Endothelial-specific") %>% distinct(ligand) %>% nrow() -1)), 
  width_ligand_target,
  rep(width_same_cell_same_target_type, times = (circos_links %>% filter(target_type == "p_emt") %>% distinct(target) %>% nrow() -1)),
  width_ligand_target
  )
```


Render the circos plot (all links same transparancy). Only the widths of the blocks that indicate each target gene is proportional the ligand-target regulatory potential (~prior knowledge supporting the regulatory interaction).  
```{r}
circos.par(gap.degree = gaps)
chordDiagram(links_circle, directional = 1,order=order,link.sort = TRUE, link.decreasing = FALSE, grid.col = grid_col,transparency = 0, diffHeight = 0.005, direction.type = c("diffHeight", "arrows"),link.arr.type = "big.arrow", link.visible = links_circle$weight >= cutoff_include_all_ligands,annotationTrack = "grid", 
    preAllocateTracks = list(track.height = 0.075))
# we go back to the first track and customize sector labels
circos.track(track.index = 1, panel.fun = function(x, y) {
    circos.text(CELL_META$xcenter, CELL_META$ylim[1], CELL_META$sector.index,
        facing = "clockwise", niceFacing = TRUE, adj = c(0, 0.55), cex = 1)
}, bg.border = NA)
```

```{r}
circos.clear()
```

Render the circos plot (degree of transparancy determined by the regulatory potential value of a ligand-target interaction)  
```{r}
circos.par(gap.degree = gaps)

    preAllocateTracks = list(track.height = 0.075))
# we go back to the first track and customize sector labels
circos.track(track.index = 1, panel.fun = function(x, y) {
    circos.text(CELL_META$xcenter, CELL_META$ylim[1], CELL_META$sector.index,
        facing = "clockwise", niceFacing = TRUE, adj = c(0, 0.55), cex = 1)
