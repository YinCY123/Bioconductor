## Abstract  
Bioconductor has advanced facilities for analysis of microarray platforms including Affymetrix, Illumina, Nimblegen, Agilent, and other one- and two-color technologies. Bioconductor includes extensive support for analysis of expression arrays, and well-developed support for exon, copy number, SNP, methylation, and other assays. Major workflows in Bioconductor include pre-processing, quality assessment, differential expression, clustering and classification, gene set enrichment analysis, and genetical genomics. Bioconductor offers extensive interfaces to community resources, including GEO, ArrayExpress, Biomart, genome browsers, GO, KEGG, and diverse annotation sources.
